### 🎯 Introduction
## Our Approach to Personalization  
We follow a simple yet powerful mantra:  

**Data + Interactions = Recommendations + Actionable Insights**  

Traditional systems struggle with contextual relationships and suffer from the cold-start problem. To overcome this, we leverage **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to build scalable personalization engines.**Explainability** is at the core of our system, providing clear, data-driven reasoning behind every product or service recommendation for our banking customers. Major computational tasks are offloaded as scheduled jobs, running periodically outside business hours to enhance reliability and minimize latency.

Our goal is to embrace this evolution while proactively addressing these challenges to deliver innovative, efficient solutions.
